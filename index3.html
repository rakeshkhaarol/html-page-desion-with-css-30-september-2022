                The Centre in August had said that NavIC is as good as the GPS in terms of position accuracy. The 2021 satellite navigation policy had stated that the government will work towards expanding the coverage to ensure the availability of the NavIC signal in any corner of the world.

                The Narendra Modi government is pushing for a 'Made In India' navigation system in the new devices sold in the country from next year. NavIC is being touted as the alternative to the prevalent Global Positioning Service (GPS) Navigation System. The decision has already jolted the smartphone makers which cite cost issues as the incumbent chipsets in the devices are tuned to support frequency band suitable for GPS and Russian system GLONASS.

            <p  style="font: 1em sans-serif;">
                After several media reports claimed the Centre had asked the smartphone makers to ensure their products were compatible with NavIC within months, the ministry of electronics and information technology issued a clarification.
